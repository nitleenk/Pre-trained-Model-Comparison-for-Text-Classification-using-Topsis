# Pre-trained-Model-Comparison-for-Text-Classification-using-Topsis

## Overview
This repository provides a simple and efficient tool for comparing pre-trained models using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. TOPSIS is a decision-making technique that helps evaluate and rank alternative solutions based on their proximity to the ideal solution.

## Features
- 1. Easy Comparison: Quickly compare multiple pre-trained models.
- 2. Customizable Metrics: Evaluate models based on various metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall).
  3. Models: Real-world pretrained models, such as bert-base-uncased, roberta_base, distilbert-base-uncased,xlnet-base-cased, t5-small, and albert-base-v2, are included in the comparison. These models are widely used in text classification tasks.
