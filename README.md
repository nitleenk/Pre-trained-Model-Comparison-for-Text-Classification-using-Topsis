# Pre-trained-Model-Comparison-for-Text-Classification-using-Topsis

##Overview
This repository provides a simple and efficient tool for comparing pre-trained models using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. TOPSIS is a decision-making technique that helps evaluate and rank alternative solutions based on their proximity to the ideal solution.

Features
Easy Comparison: Quickly compare multiple pre-trained models.
Customizable Metrics: Evaluate models based on various metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall).

TOPSIS Analysis: Utilize the TOPSIS method to rank models and identify the most suitable one.

Steps: 
Start --> Load Data --> Preprocess --> Select Metrics --> Apply Topsis --> Rank Models --> Visualize Resukts --> End
